# Text-Editor

## Description

My motivation for this project was to get more familiar through PWA. I built this because I wanted to become more familiar and more comfortable with using PWA's and gain a better understanding. This helps create notes or code snippets with or without internet connection that you are able to use later.

## Installation

1- open the application through your terminal and install all your depedencies. 2- type in 'npm run build' which will give you your dist folder and then type in 'npm run start' to start the application. 3- once the application opens you are then able to edit and type in the text you want and even install (click the install button OR install through your URL icon).
